<h4>Splits</h4>

<p>Have you ever received a workout from your coach that reads something like this?</p>
<cite>3 sets of 1600m @ 10k pace, 400m recover, 1200m @ 5k pace, 400m recover, 800m @ 5k pace, 400m recover, 300m @ 1 mile pace, 3 minutes rest</cite>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    The split tool is to help you figure out what speeds to run each of the intervals (e.g.: 300m @ 1-mile pace) by plugging in your race results for the respective distances and breaking up the "splits" so you know how fast to run during each phase of your workout.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>tip!</strong>: write the appropriate splits on a wristband or your arm so you don't forget during in your workout

<h4>AG (Age Grade Table)</h4>

<div>

    <h5>Age Grading: how it works</h5>

    <p>The Age Grading (handicap tables) used in this tool are based on world record performances in each discipline/age group.
        By comparing against these times which improve/degrade with age one can get a better handle how one's performances compare with their performances at previous ages and
        those in different age classes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> &gt100% = World record level
        <li> &gt90% = World class
        <li> &gt80% = National class
        <li> &gt70% = Regional class
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Age-graded tables were researched and compiled by the WMA (formerly WAVA), the world governing body for Masters Track & Field, Long Distance Running and Racewalking. Age Grade tables exist for ages 8 through 100 for all major
        events.
