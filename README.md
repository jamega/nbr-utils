nbr-utils is an open-source set of training utilities for runners. 

#Splits

Have you ever received a workout from your coach that reads something like this?

3 sets of 1600m @ 10k pace, 400m recover, 1200m @ 5k pace, 400m recover, 800m @ 5k pace, 400m recover, 300m @ 1 mile pace, 3 minutes rest 

The split tool is to help you figure out what speeds to run each of the intervals (e.g.: 300m @ 1-mile pace) by plugging in your race results for the respective distances and breaking up the "splits" so you know how fast to run during each phase of your workout.

tip!: write the appropriate splits on a wristband or your arm so you don't forget during in your workout

#AG (Age Grade Table)

Age Grading: how it works

The Age Grading (handicap tables) used in this tool are based on world record performances in each discipline/age group. By comparing against these times which improve/degrade with age one can get a better handle how one's performances compare with their performances at previous ages and those in different age classes.

100% = World record level
90% = World class
80% = National class
70% = Regional class

The Age-graded tables were researched and compiled by the WMA (formerly WAVA), the world governing body for Masters Track & Field, Long Distance Running and Racewalking. Age Grade tables exist for ages 8 through 100 for all major events.

#Weather

Right now it tells me the minimum amount of information I need to know about the weather where I live to make appropriate clothing decisions for my runs.  A convenient enhancement would be to support locations based on IP address.
